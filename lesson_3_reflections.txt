When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
--> When we are working on projects which have more collaborators, we can use a remote 
repository as many people can create and change contents in the repository in this fashion.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
--> Many contributors can work on a project at any given time. It will be a lot of 
pull calls if Git does pull automatically. So, we can pull changes when we want to 
work on it whenever we want to.
